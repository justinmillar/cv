      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item {Online Course (~120 to 150 students)}
        \item {Description: Conceptual and practical understanding of the application of statistics in the agricultural and life sciences using a combination of lectures, programming demonstrations, data exercises using the programming language R, group activities, and primary literature to teach introductory statistics at the graduate level}
        \item {Duties: Grading assignments, monitoring and responding to weekly discussion boards, serving as first contact for questions on content and issues with quizzes/exams, proofing assignments and final exam, holding weekly office hours}
        \item {Created \href{https://sta6093.justinmillar.com/}{additional notes and content} and \href{https://justinmillar.github.io/STA6093/ps01_nba-scout.html}{a comprehensive bonus assignment}}

    {Introduction to Bayesian Statistics} % Training Title 
    {} % Location
    {Spring 2016} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Description: Introduce life scientists to Bayesian statistics. We will explore basic ideas regarding integration through simulation (Monte Carlo integration), the philosophy and strengths of Bayesian statistics, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms needed to fit such models. We will focus on several real world examples and how to transform these problems into statistical models. This course will rely on substantial extra-class work, in order to provide students with extensive hands on experience on conceptualizing, implementing, and interpreting the results of these models. Ideally, this experience will be enough to enable students to develop their own Bayesian models after this course is over. We will try to cover simple (e.g., Normal and Poisson), mixed effect and multi-level regression models but this will fundamentally depend on the speed with which the class is able to follow the course. Implementation of these models will be done both with JAGS as well as customized R code}
        \item {Duties: Grade weekly assignments (focused on R and JAGS code), grade group presentations, organize weekly "queries" from students, hold weekly office hours}
        \item {Motivated groups to develop webpages outlining their projects and contribute to \href{http://bayescourse.updog.co/}{new course website}}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Description: Introduce students to how food companies do research to improve their products, and to have students carry out a research project of their own. With generous financial support from ConAgra Foods (makers of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, Reddi-Wip, and Parkay Margarine, among others), students will conduct experiments on a genuine research question associated with either ConAgra's Orville Redenbacher or Act II microwave popcorn}

    {Fall 2010} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Description: Study of the building blocks of cells, the gross anatomy of the cell, and the structures and organelles that perform the work necessary for cell function. We will also examine several cellular processes at the molecular level, including the central dogma of molecular biology: RNA transcription and protein translation. We will examine the bioenergetic processes necessary to sustain life; first photosynthesis, the mechanism by which plant chloroplasts capture light energy to make the carbohydrates that bring life to earth. We then discuss the mitochondria and how they break down carbohydrates to release energy. All topics will be framed within the context of the human physiology. Mastery of these topics will provide you with an understanding of modern molecular and cellular biology}
