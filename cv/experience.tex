      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item Adapted a \href{https://github.com/justinmillar/bma-malaria}{novel approach for detecting malaria risk factors using Bayesian model averaging}, providing a semi-parametric framework which produces fully interpretable models that account for uncertainty in model selection and outperformed logistic and LASSO regression in out-of-sample prediction
        \item {Developed a conceptual framework for comparing the cost-effectiveness of presumptive treatment versus test-then-treat for mass malaria interventions, and then used publicly available data to create a \href{https://jjmillar.shinyapps.io/msat-example/}{web-based decision support tool}}
        \item {Analyzed the impact of local health facilities on early childhood malaria in northern Ghana, created additive model to optimize location of new health facility, and developed \href{https://jjmillar.shinyapps.io/byd-health-facilities/}{web-based application to provide real-time projections on cases and disease prevalence}}
        \item {Organized research trip to Ghana to \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aaZZUpO4PkgKTxZbqvZhFuNVgYWsh6LXcdkYGrNC2Cg/edit?usp=sharing}{present research findings to collaborators} and participate in field collection and lab identification}
        \item {Served as a teaching assist for two statistics-focused courses and founded open session for learning R programming (\href{http://www.r-gators.com/}{UF R Meetup})}
